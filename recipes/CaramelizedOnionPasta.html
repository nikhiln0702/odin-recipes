        <li>1/4 cup matchstick-cut sun-dried tomatoes

        </li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce

        </li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons chili onion crunch (such as Trader Joe’s®) or more to taste

        </li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

        </li>
        <li> 8 ounces spaghetti

        </li>

        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or as needed for garnish

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Heat olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in onions until well coated. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they start to caramelize and turn golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. You can add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as onion mixture cooks to speed up caramelization and keep onions moist.

        </li>
        <li>Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in sun-dried tomatoes, soy sauce, chili onion crunch, and season with salt and pepper.

        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water.

        </li>
        <li>Transfer pasta to the skillet with caramelized onions. Toss everything together until well coated, and stir in remaining tablespoon of butter. Add reserved pasta water, if needed, a tablespoon at a time.

        </li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped parsley and Parmesan cheese, and serve.
